# Hi, I'm Angela! 👋

Software Engineer • Frontend Developer • Educator • Streamer • Creator

After more than a decade as a frontend developer, I’ve worked on thousands of projects—ranging from small business websites to large-scale university systems. I have a degree in Software Engineering and a strong foundation in object-oriented programming — earned the hard way, and I’m proud of it.

These days, I focus on teaching and mentoring through live streams, tutorials, and open source projects. My [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@angelajholden) is all about learning by doing — building from scratch with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help devs truly understand the web.

## 🍋 What I'm Working On

-   **Live coding streams** every Saturday and Sunday on YouTube
-   **UI tutorials** and videos focused on CSS, accessibility, and responsive layouts
-   **A new video series**: _Inspect With Respect_ — collaborative audits of public websites
-   **My personal blog** — built with HTML, SCSS, and a lot of care (Angular + Strapi coming soon)

## ✨ Core Skills

-   Semantic HTML, modern CSS, and responsive layout systems
-   Accessibility and SEO best practices
-   Vanilla JavaScript and frontend workflows
-   Git, GitHub, and practical open source collaboration
-   Building without frameworks for clarity — but trained to use them when needed
-   Advanced Velocity templating in CMS environments like Cascade Server
