# Hi, I'm Angela! 👋

## 🌱 Software Engineer • Frontend Developer • Educator • Streamer • Creator

After more than a decade as a frontend developer, I’ve worked on thousands of projects—ranging from small business websites to large-scale university systems. I have a degree in Software Engineering and a strong foundation in object-oriented programming.

These days, I focus on teaching and mentoring through live streams, tutorials, and open source projects. My [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@angelajholden) is all about learning by doing — building from scratch with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help devs truly understand the web.
